## What is Hazel?

> "The plan for Hazel is two-fold: to create a powerful 3D engine, but also to serve as an education tool for teaching game engine design and architecture" - from the [official readme](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel/blob/master/README.md) (18 Nov 2019)

`Hazel` is an open source application/game engine being developed by [TheCherno (Yan Chernikov)](https://thecherno.com/) via a [YouTube series](https://thecherno.com/engine). It is officially hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel).

Hazel currently has a large set of engine-based features, all of which are prepared for cross-platform support. This is because though Hazel currently only supports Windows, Cherno plans to create Hazel versions for MacOS and Linux, as well as building support for Android and IOS.

## What is HazelWiki?

HazelWiki is the unofficial community-driven collaborative wiki for Hazel. It is hosted [here](https://thechernocommunity.github.io/HazelWiki/). The idea is to have a place to note down specific things that we pick up with regards to documentation or the API until Cherno goes about making an official place to keep all the information.

## Where to begin?

If you're new to Hazel, then an important thing to know is that Hazel is far from featureful. Though the community does work hard, Hazel is not at a point where it can compete with engines like Unity and Godot. So, if you simply desire to make a game, we do recommend not using Hazel just yet.

If you want to contribute to the engine or simply want to have a poke around the engine, then you can check out [this page](https://thechernocommunity.github.io/HazelWiki/BuildingHazel) for more information about how to set it up on your machine.

## How to contribute to Hazel?

If you want to contribute to Hazel directly you can start at the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and then make issues and pull requests to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) for your contributions. We also recommend joining the [Cherno discord community](https://thecherno.com/discord) to discuss all things programming.

You can also support Hazel and Cherno by becoming a patron on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/thecherno) which can also give you access to the private Hazel development repository which is far more advanced than the public facing Hazel repository.
