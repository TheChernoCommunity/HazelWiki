about: For issues that are not a bug report, feature request, or grammar fix.

Please consider using the Bug report, Feature request, or Grammar Fix template. If it doesn't belong there, feel free to use this (empty) template. Make sure to provide enough details so it is clear for contributors to help you out. Premature or incomplete issues cannot be resolved due to lack of information or unclear descriptions.

Make sure your issue can be reproduced with the HazelWiki and not by your own forks that you're creating alongside with HazelWiki. For issues with fork, we're happy to help you in [TheCherno Discord server](https://thecherno.com/discord). Thanks for your understanding.
